## Reduce waste, make cooking easy, and keep it fresh <3
Rongo is a smart app designed to minimize food waste and simplify cooking while promoting sustainability. With an intuitive homepage overview, Rongo tracks new, expiring, and expired items in your fridge. Use speech-to-text to log consumed items effortlessly, and share your fridge with family members, allowing them to add notes and photos. The app's scanning feature, powered by the Gemini API, provides detailed information on items, including expiry dates, allergens, and storage tips. You can also use OCR to manage grocery receipts and automatically update your fridge inventory. Rongo generates recipe suggestions based on your fridge's contents and features a chatbot for cooking assistance. By integrating the Gemini API, Rongo enhances user experience through accurate speech-to-text, advanced scanning, and interactive chatbot capabilities, aligning with UN Sustainable Development Goals by promoting resource efficiency and reducing food waste.
